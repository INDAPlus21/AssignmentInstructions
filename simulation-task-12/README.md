# DD1338 Week 12

_Disclaimer_: Life has it's challenges! I aim to push an example. Plz have patience.

## The Nature of Code

When I was 13, my chemistry teacher claimed: "Allt Ã¤r kemi!". Well, as simmer who has watched _The Matrix_, I beleive that everything is a mess of bugs and features (the differenses are decided by subjectivity, ideology, and performance-enhancing aids).

With all the BAS-MATTE, LINALG, and zombified Fysik 1-2, you are ready to take on AD through the lense of simulation; in this case, extremely basic simulation.

_The Nature of Code_ is a 14 week course written by [Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/featured). It covers the basics of physics simulation, including particle systems and flocking behaiviour. Your assignment for the next week is to follow and implement one chapter of _The Nature of Code_. Yes, this do include the front-end samples.

Book: https://natureofcode.com/book/preface/ 

### Prepare Assignment

1) Create a repository named `<KTH_ID>-task-12` under the `INDAPlus21` organisation and clone it. (Or don't, looking at you `@haskellers`!)
2) Navigate into your newly created repository and start writing.
    - Implement the logic of a chapter of choise.
    - Visualise the logic, either like the book samples, or something more creative.
    - Consider writing unit tests as practise.

**Goldstar** for the Rustacean who explore the wonders of Rust by implementing the solution using Rust WebAssembly (logic implementation in Rust and frontend in Javascript). See a [tutorial for game of life](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/introduction.html).

**Note**: You may implemet your solution using any language (this includes Python *_host_ psudokod *_host_ *_host_). The only drawback is that the book assume that you run OOB. Obviously, this is not the case (for me). However, you should be able to do your own interpretations.

### Grading

Because your solution can be implemented using any language, write in a README file of how to build and run your application (that includes how to run any unit tests and your frontend application).

> Haskell note: Please dont implement quicksort in like 3 lines, we know it can be done, its cool. But its not efficient.
