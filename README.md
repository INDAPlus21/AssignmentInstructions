### Clean Code

Read about good documentation and healthy code habits. Recommended for all programmers. Can be bought at KÃ¥rbokhandeln or read as [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwaHnAYlcNWdNU16VF82eEZfRjQ/view?usp=sharing).

### The mighty G-drive

> Somewhere far far away was a drive, a legendary drive. Tales claim even the fabled Ric himself has seen it. Heed, heed thee glory! For this plentiful store may bless us with its content.

**NOTE**: The older supreme drive, may it rest in peace, was taken down due to social drama. This is an arbritary copy-cat with most of the relevant literature for the computer science program. Thanks to the anonomus publishing user _Bok Bok_. Enjoy!
