# DD1337 Week 5

## Chess GUI Project

Congratulation ettan! You are now a proved owner of a killer ass chess engine. It's time to make it fabulous! Your assignment this week is to write a GUI applikation for your chess engine.

To write a front-end in Rust, we'll use the [Good Game Easily library (GGEZ)](https://ggez.rs/). For help, you're refeered to the library documentations with very good examples.

Take inspiration from existing chess games or go crazy and make something rustacular!

### Prepare assignment

1) Create a repository named `<KTH_ID>-chess-gui` under the `INDAPlus21` organisation and clone it.
2) Navigate into your newly created repository and initialise a Rust application crate (like you did the first week).

See the template crate for help with code setup.

#### Chess GUI template

Navigate in your command prompt/terminal to `./rust-task-5/chess-gui-template`. Run the application to show an empty chess board with the game state shown in text. 

The `resources` directory contains image files for all chess pieces and the application icon file. The chess pieces image files are loaded into image structures; a gift from me to you. Switch out the image files if you prefer to render the pieces in a different style. 

To switch from the uncomplete `chess-template` engine repository as a dependency, to one of your comrade's state of the art creations, change the target URL in the `Cargo.toml` file.
```toml
chess_template = { git = "https://github.com/INDAPlus21/chess-template.git" }
```

### Grade

To pass this assignment, write a GUI application which allows you to both play and replay chess. The *CATCH* is that you cannot use your own chess engine(!). Therefore, if your chess engine implementation differs from the specifications stated in the `rust-task-3` instructions, write your own API specifications in a README markdown file and push it to your engine repository.
