# DD1338 Week 14

We hope you have had a great time with your holidays, and your code has been blessed! Now its time to get on coding (for school) again. Yay! 

## The Internet is for... Fun!

This weeks task is to work with sockets! To do this, you will have to select a programming language of your choice and figure out how sockets work in that language. Most languages, like Java, have built in objects for sockets that are really easy to work with. Rust offers networking functionality via its standard library.

To get you started, you can read [this guide](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/) on Python sockets. The guide also shares its source code [here](https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/python-sockets-tutorial). *// Tobbe*

To properly get started, the Rust book's [multithreaded server example project](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html). _// Viola_

### Prepare your assignment

1. Create a repository named `<KTH_ID>-sockets` (Haskellers: You already have your repos in `inda-20`).
2. Start working on your preffered assignment.

I (Tobias) have provided some of my old Java code under `./examples` a server and client program. The client sends two numbers to the server that adds them together and send the result back to the client. Your job will be to make something more advanced but the example code should set you off if you want to use Java.

I (Viola) touched up a very simple Rust server and a client binary. Check it out!

## Assignments

This week you can select between two plus-assignments or the regular assignment!

### 1. Make a chat client and server!

The main point of this week is to make a server and client that can communicate with each other using sockets. For this assignment, we want your server to support multiple clients, meaning that two (bonus assignment: or more) clients can connect and communicate with each other trough the server.

### 2. Improve your game(s)!

If you want to you could add some form of multiplayer functionality to your games from last week. This could be to allow player vs. player (PvP), or you could do that as well as adding an ingame chat while playing multiplayer. This option allows you to work alone or continue working with your partner from `task-12/13`

### 3. Regular task

As always, if you don't want to do the plus assignments that we hand out, you can always do the regular Java assignments!
